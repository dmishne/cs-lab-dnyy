#description Same as CEntry API - all you need to know about search API

in this we must make sure we don't have many problems as Search repeats itself in many variations. 

&lt;BR/&gt;



<h4> CEntry Params </h4>
> -msg type = "SearchBook" / "SearchReview" ; 

&lt;BR/&gt;


> -user privilage cannot be disabled (-1)! 

&lt;BR/&gt;



<h4> CEntry.map Params </h4>
> -there should be no extras or "bonuses" at the map
> -params are to be specific, lower cased, simple words.
> > e.g. "title", $title\_Key (String)
> > > "author", "publisher" ..

> > do write down what params you are using, as db is not yet capable of handling the routine.
