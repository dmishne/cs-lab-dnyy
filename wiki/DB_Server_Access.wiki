= Introduction =

Our server is opened!
we got a nice address on a good server with remote control - take care of it!



= Details =
address is *remote-mysql4.servage.net*
port: *3306*
username: *nirgeffen*
password: *q1w2e3r4*

if you're trying to _restore_ scheme and get an error, first check that you aren't trying to  restore the original scheme, choose another scheme.

also, make sure to back-up and upload the backup before you make the change so everything will be *_reversible_*.

enjoy :)
