#description Same as CEntry API - all you need to know about search API

in this we must make sure we don't have many problems as Search repeats itself in many variations. <BR/>

<h4> CEntry Params </h4>
   -msg type = "Searchbook"; <BR/>
   -user privilage cannot be disabled (-1)! <BR/> 

<h4> CEntry.map Params </h4>
   -there should be no extras or "bonuses" at the map
   -params are to be specific, lower cased, simple words.
    e.g. "title", $title_Key (String)
         "author", "publisher" ..
    do write down what params you are using, as db is not yet capable of handling the routine.
